		      <h2><a style="color:white" href="#about">Help Us Stay Alive</a></h2>
		      <p>Dear Surveyor, Please donate what you can afford to help the Land Surveyors United Community stay alive. You may not know it, but we’re an independent website that the entire world of surveyors depend on. We are dedicated to staying free for all land surveyors but we still have bills to pay. Most users can’t afford to donate, but we hope you can. If everyone chips in $5, we can keep this going for free. For the price of a meal, we can preserve a website forever. We built the Land Surveyors United because open access to knowledge is fragile. If you find our site useful, chip in what you can today. Thank you. ~Justin Farrow</p>

		      <h2><a style="color:white" href="#services">Monthly Community Costs</a></h2>
		      <p>It costs roughly $470 per month to host and maintain this community. For over 15 years, Justin has paid for this out of pocket while surviving as graduate student. We do not sell your data or crowd your learning with distractions on the site. Your donation will go towards keeping LSU alive and free for the entire Surveying Industry. If we are not able to raise the funds needs for operation, we will have to search for alternative means to meet financial requirements.<a href="#" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eVWJLtg4Dl0AkRI133Zohjo-m4W-wujPlCer3JCGV4OiESRWcnwyPBVnc7Mj-N5mj9SU-cbPcFNLiGeEQJw=w1080-h842-rw" width="100%" class="align-full" /></a></p>

		      <h2><a style="color:white" href="#portfolio">Our Global Mission</a></h2>
		      <p>Our mission is to provide avenues of professional development for land surveyors worldwide.  Students leaving school are most times not properly equipped to work in the field.  They need the expertise and guidance from those who have been in the field in order to perform their jobs.  On Land Surveyors United, we all learn from one another and support each other across borders.</p>
